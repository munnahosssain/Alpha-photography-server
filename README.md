## Project Purpose
This project was made to test my knowledge on the basic structure of a website in ReactJs. It serves as my first full length project started from Programming Hero. Since this project was a test of my knowledge, i used as little help resources as i could with the exception of UI some css features such as the broken navbar. And assistance with React Hooks Form.

This allowed me to see where my strengths where and which sections i needed to work on.

## Hardest Sections & Lessons Learnt

The navbar was particularly difficult because i had not React Hook forms yet therefore i relied on floats to move my navigation content. This seemed like a good resolution until the navigation links started getting kicked out of the header section. A fix to this was to make sure the nav links were structured before the logo in html.

### Working Solution
The above solution was only temporary and it didn't work as well as i wanted it to so i went on to learn React Hook forms so i can find a fix for it

## Additional Challenges
Styling the forms has been very difficult because i had recently started learning React Hook forms. I am still not an expert at React Hook forms, however, i can execute React Hook forms better than i did in this project. I will not try to fix or change the way i solved it in this project. The reason being i would like to look back at this code one day and see the growth i had.

## Final thoughts

This project was not easy at all and the longer i worked on it, the more it took out of me. I started strong and i burnt out 80% through. With that being said, it has also been my favorite project so far because i did not rely fully on tutorials to complete it. I only used tutorials to understand smaller concepts and not full sections.
